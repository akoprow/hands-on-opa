Weekend chat about Opa: Matthieu Guffroy
----------------------------------------

Welcome to ``the weekend chat about Opa''. I'm planning to make it into a regular (weekly?) column on the blog. The idea is simple: let people who tried Opa speak about their experience. What they liked, what they did not etc. Clearly, I'm biased, so I hope it will be refreshing to hear what others (not associated with MLstate) have to say on the subject. So if anyone out there did some Opa coding and wants to share his/her experience, mailto:Adam.Koprowski@mlstate.com[let me know]!

*me*: _Can you tell us a bit about yourself?_ +
*http://mattgu.com[{guest}]*: I'm a 19 years old student in computer science at the University of Technology of Compi√®gne in France. I have started a http://www.mattgu.com[blog], in which I will talk about my various projects in Opa. When I'm not behind a computer, I like to play Rugby!

*me*: _How did you learn about Opa?_ +
*{g}*: First time I heard about it in 2009 when I met Cedric Soulas at the Prologin Final (a French algorithmic contest). Cedric made a presentation about Opa and I liked the idea. Afterwords I briefly worked at MLstate (1 month, kind of an internship).

*me*: _Can you tell a bit about the app that you developed? Was it an university project? Or did you do it just for fun?_ +
*{g}*: First I wrote https://github.com/mattgu74/OpaTetris[OpaTetris]. That was just for fun, because I believe that doing things yourself is a best way to learn :). Now I wrote https://github.com/mattgu74/OpaCms[OpaCms]. For the moment also just for fun, but I hope to use it for a website of an association at my school and my personal website.

*me*: _What other technologies are you familiar with?_ +
*{g}*: Unfortunately none if you look at my school's curriculum. But I started playing with web development since I was 8 years old. I discovered PHP when I was 13-14 and since then am familiar with web technologies (HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL/Javascript). +
I also know C, C++, some Java (I made an Android game for a university project). I'm also a sys-admin for the server of an association of my school (Bash, Python).

*me*: _What do you like about Opa? Compared to them? What's better? What's worse?_ +
*{g}*: When coding with Opa, I think more about what I want and less about how to do that... Also when your Opa program compiles you can be pretty sure it will work for all cases. With Opa, I have the impression I am more productive. +
A new thing for me is that Opa is a functional language. I think it can be quite disconcerting at first, but after I understood how it works, I like that ;)

*me*: _Do you think Opa has a chance of becoming a popular language for web development?_ +
*{g}*: I hope that Opa has more than just a chance. I think all developers must try Opa, if just for a little. It's a real pleasure to work with Opa. Afterward you just can't go back to an ugly technology like PHP. And thinking about configuring Apache, PHP, MySQL on a server is just a nightmare... With Opa apps, you just have to upload your .exe and launch it...

*me*: _Anything else you'd like to say? :)_ +
*{g}* Don't hesitate to take a look on OpaCms: http://opacmsdemo.mattgu.com[demo], https://github.com/mattgu74/OpaCms[code]. Your help will be very welcome :).

*me*: _Ok, thank you very much for your time and for being so positive about Opa!_
