Reusing JavaScript libraries: JQuery UI
---------------------------------------

Opa is great for new developments, but it's a fact that there are numerous great JavaScript libraries out there and one does not want to code them again in Opa. Gladly, that's not necessary. Opa can easily communicate with existing JavaScript code and in this tutorial we will see how.

As an illustrating example I will follow http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/opa/2012-January/000556.html[user's suggestion] and will show how to use http://jqueryui.com[jQuery UI] and its capabilities to obtain a re-sizable container.

[NOTE]
=======================
You will learn:

* How to write Opa plug-ins: packaging libraries in other languages (like JavaScript) for re-use in Opa.
* How to build an Opa package on top of such a plug-in: exposing foreign libraries to Opa programs.
* How to create a re-sizable container using jQuery UI.
=======================

Getting started with jQuery UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want to use jQuery UI in Opa. If you look at the http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started[Getting started] section of jQuery UI documentation it essentially says to follow those steps:

. Download a custom jQuery UI bundle.
. Link jQuery code.
. Link jQuery UI code.
. Link to jQuery UI CSS.

First let's head to the http://jqueryui.com/download[download page] and build our bundle. In this tutorial we only want to use the Resizable Interaction of jQuery so deselect all and only select +Resizable+ (which will automatically select all dependencies as well) and then click +Download+ to get the bundle. In the next step we'll see how to instruct Opa to use this custom JavaScript.

jQuery is bundled with Opa by default so we can skip step 2. We will learn how to address step 3 in the following section and step 4 in the ``Putting it all together'' section at the end of this tutorial.

Building jQuery UI plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We'll first build a jQuery UI _plugin_ and then a jQuery UI _package_. What's the difference? A plugin is essentially a bundle of foreign code (JavaScript, Ocaml or C) that is made available for Opa. A package is just a compilation unit of Opa: when building bigger projects it's good to separate them into packages. Usually one will also build a package to safely expose selected functionality of a plugin to Opa programs; we will also do it in a minute. But let's start with the plugin.

In our project folder let's create a +jQuery-UI+ directory (for all jQuery UI related stuff) and in it a +plugin+ directory (for the plugin). Let's put the +jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.js+ file (the precise name may vary depending on the version of jQuery UI you'll be using) in the +plugin+ directory. Then let's create a +resizable.js+ so that the content of our project is as follows:

[source,log]
------------------------
+- resizable
  +- jQuery-UI
     +- plugin
       +- jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.js
       +- resizable.js
------------------------

Now let's put the following content in +resizable.js+

[source, javascript]
------------------------
##extern-type dom_element

##register mk_resizable: dom_element -> dom_element
##args(dom)
{
    return dom.resizable({animate: true});
}
------------------------

Ok, some explanation is in order. What you can see above is a JavaScript code with some annotations (starting with +##+). Why do we need that? Well, JavaScript is very loosely typed and since we want to interact with the strongly typed world of Opa, how do we do that? The solution used in Opa is to introduce typing for JavaScript functions (only those that we want to directly use from Opa programs) and this is done using those annotations. Let's look at them in turn.

First we have:

[source, javascript]
------------------------
##extern-type dom_element
------------------------

This essentially indicates that there exists (defined somewhere else) a type +dom_element+. Indeed, this type is define in the standard library in the module https://github.com/MLstate/opalang/blob/master/stdlib/core/xhtml/dom.opa#L2136[+Dom+] and represents a DOM element (basically, part of the content of the page).

Then in the following function definition

[source, javascript]
------------------------
##register mk_resizable: dom_element -> dom_element
##args(dom)
------------------------

essentially replaces the traditional function definition

[source, javascript]
------------------------
function mk_resizable(dom)
------------------------

by extending it with typing information: it's a function from +dom_element+ to +dom_element+ (the +resizable+ of jQuery UI does return the object that we manipulate). So the function argument +dom+ is of type +dom_element+ and in the body of the function we call jQuery's +resizable+ method and return the result.

Of course we didn't have to put those annotations in a separate file, we could just annotated the original functions, but in case of re-using existing external libraries it's usually a better approach not to modify the original code and to put annotations in such a separate interface file.

So, that's it! How do we compile our plugin? Using +opa-plugin-builder+ (from the root of the project, i.e. the +resizable+ directory) as follows:

[source, bash]
------------------------
opa-plugin-builder --js-validator-off jQuery-UI/plugin/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.js jQuery-UI/plugin/resizable.js -o resizable.opp
------------------------

As arguments we provide the files that constitue the plugin and with the +-o+ option we inform the tool that the name of the plugin should be +resizable.opp+ (+.opp+ being the standard extension for plugins in Opa). The +--js-validator-off+ option is neccessary here, as by default the plugin builder tries to validate the JavaScript and detect potential problems. Of course turning off validation is *not recommended*, but for this tutorial it will do, as we don't want to address all the potential problems detected in the jQuery UI code.

Building jQuery UI package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is to build an Opa package exposing the functionality from the plugin. Note that for such a simple example as this one we didn't need to create a dedicated package and module for this code, but the idea is to illustrate how one would proceed when building a more serious library (say, exposing full jQuery). This is the complete code of +resizable.opa+ that we put in the +jQuery-UI+ directory:

[source, opa]
------------------------
package jquery.resizable

module Resizable {

  function mk_resizable(dom) {
    %%Resizable.mk_resizable%%(Dom.of_selection(dom))
  }

}
------------------------

The first line just indicates that this file is part of the +jquery.resizable+ package. Then we have a module +Resizable+ with single function +mk_resizable(dom)+. This function essentially calls JavaScript's +mk_resizable+ that we define above. Note the notation between +%%+, which is used to access such foreign functions; the naming convention is +<file_name>.<function_name>+.

The only other thing to notice is that we want these function to operate on Opa's type of DOM elements (http://doc.opalang.org/#!/type/stdlib.core.xhtml/dom[+dom+]), which is the default type obtained when using syntax such as +#id+ in Opa, whereas our JavaScript +mk_resizable+ function operates on http://doc.opalang.org/#!/type/stdlib.core.xhtml/dom_element[+dom_element+], the low-level JavaScript equivalent of that type, so first we need to perform the conversion using the http://doc.opalang.org/#!/value/stdlib.core.xhtml/Dom/of_selection[+Dom.of_selection+] function.

We compile this package (from project's root) with (note the inclusion of the +resizable.opp+ plugin):

[source, bash]
------------------------
opa --parser js-like jQuery-UI/resizable.opa resizable.opp
------------------------

Putting it all together:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you look at 4-point roadmap at the beginning of this article you'll realize that we still need to take care of point 4, that is including jQuery UI's CSS. This is very simple; first we create a +resources+ directory where we put the relevant CSS file (+jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css+ in our case). Now we'll develop a very simple demo, in +demo_resizable.opa+ so that the final tree of the project looks as follows:

[source,log]
------------------------
+- resizable
  +- jQuery-UI
  |  +- plugin
  |  | +- jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.js
  |  | +- resizable.js
  |  +- resizable.opa
  +- resources
  |  +- jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css
  |  +- style.css
  +- demo_resizable.opa
------------------------

We begin by registering jQuery-UI's CSS and using resources from the +resources+ directory with the following server construction:

[source, opa]
------------------------
Server.start(Server.http,
  [ { resources: @static_resource_directory("resources") }
  , { register: [ "resources/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css"
                , "resources/style.css"
                ]
    }
  , {title: "jQuery-UI demo", ~page}
  ]
)
------------------------

Now the main +page+ function looks as follows:

[source, opa]
------------------------
function page() {
  msg =
    <div id=#msg class="alert-message warning"
         onready={function (_) { Resizable.mk_resizable(#msg) }}>
      <p><strong>Notice:</> this box is resizable; try dragging at its edges.</>
    </>
  WBootstrap.Layout.fixed(msg)
}
------------------------

We use Bootstrap to create a fixed layout and to create an alert message with id +msg+. Then on its +onready+ event we invoke our function to make this element resizable. And that's it! Of course in a more serious application we could think of a better interface for this functionality so that creating resizable elements would be easier and would not require directly dealing with the +onready+ handler. But that's outside the scope of this article. Besides, if you were reading carefully all the articles on this blog, I hope you have a pretty good idea on how to approach that.

We finish off by compiling this demo with (the +resizable+ package will be found automatically as it was compiled in the same directory):

[source, bash]
------------------------
opa --parser js-like demo_resizable.opa -o resizable.exe
------------------------

If you're feeling adventerous then I stroungly encourage you to browse through the plugins that are shipped together with the Opa compiler (see https://github.com/MLstate/opalang/tree/master/plugins[here] or check the plugin sub-directory in your local sources of the compiler) -- that can be a great way to learn more about plugins.

Ok, that turned out to be a pretty long tutorial. Hope you enjoyed it. More to come!
