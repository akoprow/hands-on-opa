``Hello Bootstrap'' in Opa
--------------------------

Hello, dear readers. Adam is on holidays (enjoy them, Adam !), and I, another
Opa addict, will try to keep this blog a lively virtual place. I want to share
with you an event that happened last week. An apparently insignificant event: a
company in the Valley published its HTML+CSS basic toolkit. Not just any
company, of course, since we're talking about Twitter. Yet, we're only talking
about CSS, not about a revolutionary one-tier functional language for the web
and the cloud, if you see what I mean...

You can find the project at: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap, and its
GitHub repository here: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.

The buzz around it has been huge since then, and many developpers who want
something that looks good without pain, just love it. As a simple evidence of
this enthusiasm, it reached the top 10 of the most vatched projects on GitHub in
less than a week.

In Opa, of course, it's very easy to integrate any external CSS. One of the
simplest way, is to use +Resource.styled_page+. Yet, we wanted to do more. We
wanted to make it *really* easy ot use bootstrap. Plus, we wanted to extend it a
bit, by providing standard icons compatible with the style. So we created a
package in the standard library for this.

It was not a big deal:

* to load Bootstrap's CSS transparently (upon inclusion of the package), we used +Resource.register_external_css+;

* to include our home-made, Bootstrap-compatible, icons:

** we put them in a directory, and used +@static_include_directory+ on it;

** we used the +DynamicResource+ module to publish each of the image at a URL;

** we defined CSS classes using these URLs in Opa (rather than externally), in order to use inserts, e.g.:
+
[source, css]
------------------------
.icon.icon-black {background: {get_img("icons16-black.png")} no-repeat;}
------------------------
+
** then we asked Opa to transparently register these classes declarations with
   the (rather undocumented) function +Client_code.register_css_declaration+.

But you, dear users, don't have to care about all this internal soup. What you
need to know is that, now, to take benefit of Twitter's great CSS framework
augmented with our nice icons, you only have to:

[source, opa]
------------------------
import stdlib.themes.bootstrap
------------------------

Simple enough ?

So here's how our venerable +hello_chat.opa+ now looks like (we just plugged in
Bootstrap's classes names):

[source, opa]
------------------------
include::../examples/hello_chat/hello_chat.opa[]
------------------------

And it's companion CSS file is now much simpler:
[source, css]
------------------------
include::../examples/hello_chat/resources/css.css[]
------------------------
