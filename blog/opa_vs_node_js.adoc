Node.js VS Opa
--------------

In today's article we will try to see how two uprising programming languages for the web stack against each other: http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] and http://opalang.org/[Opa].

On first sight they have quite a bit in common: both are targeting development of web applications; both have the huge benefit of a single language for both client and server-side coding. However, there are also many important differences: Node.js is based on the well-known Javascript, whereas Opa introduces a completely new language; Node.js (as Javascript) is untyped whereas Opa is strongly typed _etc. etc._. We'll try to look more closely at those differences, and their implications, in the remainder of this article.

[NOTE]
=======================
Even though this blog is endorsed by Opa, I really strived for an unbiased presentation here. However, knowing Opa inside out and Node.js substantially less so, there's a chance some omissions slipped in. In that case I'd be obliged if you could point that out in the comments so I could fix it. Thanks.
=======================

The contenders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Node.js is a framework for writing web servers, built on top of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)[Google's V8 JavaScript engine]. It's event-driven and uses asynchronous I/O to minimize overhead and maximize scalability. It was started in 2009 by Ryan Dahl. Node.js allows to write server-side code in Javascript, hence making it possible to use the same language for both client- and server-side coding.

Opa is an open source platform for developing web applications. It consists of a new programming language, a new web server, a new database and a new distributed execution engine, all of them tightly integrated to provide a great experience for web developers. It uses a similar asynchronous model to that of Node.js, but goes even further by supporting (out of the box) distribution of the application across multiple machines (or in the cloud). It's development was started before 2008 by Henri Binsztok and subsequently was continued by http://mlstate.com[MLstate], a company he founded.

The arena
~~~~~~~~~

To illustrate and compare those two languages we will use the example that is slowly becoming a standard benchmark for web frameworks/languages: a web chat. It's not a bad benchmark as it involves extensive client-server communication.

Below we present screenshots of chats developed, respectively, in Node.js (by Ryan Dahl, the author of Node.js himself) and in Opa (by https://github.com/Aqua-Ye[Frederic] from the Opa team). We encourage you to click on the images to play with the live application. Both applications are equivalent feature-wise (though not visually).

Below we will try to compare differences aspects of building this application with Node.js and in Opa.

Productivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developer productivity is one of the very important aspects of choosing one's tools. If you can develop fast it means you can innovate, you can quickly create prototypes, you can quickly change things and react to changing market and user needs... the list goes on and on.

There are many pitfalls of using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code[SLOCs] (Software Lines of Code) as a metric to compare productivity, but they are a good estimate and can give an impression of the effort needed to develop something. Instead of presenting raw numbers below we show a bird's-eye-view on the source code of the two projects, after removing comments & new lines (for Node.js https://github.com/ry/node_chat[sources] we only included +client.js+ and +server.js+ as the remaining files can be considered to belong to the standard library). The Opa project is on the left & Node.js is on the right.

[NOTE]
=================
This visual image more or less reflect comparing gzipped (standard measure to avoid identifier length impact) size of the sources, where the Node project is roughly twice longer (1.95x to be exact). So Opa seems to be significantly more concise, the effect of which is probably strengthened by the fact that the Opa chat additionally features the list of people currently present in the chat-room and GitHub's ``Watch'' and ``Fork'' buttons (with a somewhat verbose HTML).

Building user interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both Node.js and Opa use (X)HTML and CSS for building user interfaces. Of course, in both cases, it's possible to build libraries and abstractions on top of that layer but neither language enforces that and both allow direct, full control over the markup.

Node.js does not have any special support for HTML and the markdown is simply built as a string, with string concatenation, as https://github.com/ry/node_chat/blob/master/client.js#L227[here]. There are several problems with this approach. To begin with, no validation of the correctness of the markdown can be performed; unclosed tags, typos and the likes will have to be noticed & corrected when testing the application. But, possibly even more importantly, this poses a very serious security threat. Since HTML is treated just as a string it takes a _very_ careful development, not to allow the possibility of XSS injection slip in (where the attacker can inject and execute client-side script in the app).

On the other hand, in Opa HTML is a data type (interestingly enough it's not a primitive type but is developed as part of the language standard library), with special support in the syntax to easily write it, as https://github.com/Aqua-Ye/OpaChat/blob/master/src/main.opa#L118[here]. While on the face of it, it may look only slightly better, esthetically, the implications are far-fetching. Essentially all the aforementioned problems are solved: ill-formed markdown will be rejected by the compiler and the language offers built-in protection against XSS injections by properly escaping any values inserted in the constructed HTML.

Below we show equivalent snippet (taken from Node.js' chat) in both languages.

    <td class="msg-text">
      {text}
    </td>
  </tr>;
#log += content;

Server/client side separation & communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The final strike: debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We all know that writing the code ain't the last step -- often the ``fun'' begins only then with testing & debugging. Therefore it is only fair to see how the languages compare in that respect.

In Node.js we're dealing, both on client and on the server, with our own code. One can choose between the V8 debugger, part of http://code.google.com/p/chromedevtools/[Google Chrome Developer Tools] to debug https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/using-eclipse-as-node-applications-debugger[node code]. Crystal clear.

With Opa the situation is a bit more complicated. As of today there's no dedicated debugger. Moreover the client code is a Javascript that was automatically generated from the Opa code and, hence, as auto-generated code goes, is much less readable (although running your program with +-d+ debugging option will improve the situation somewhat).

However, there is one aspect that should not be missed here: building Opa from ground up as a new language allowed its authors to use best principles from functional programming and software verification, such as static analysis and type checking, to detect a majority of typical programming errors already at compilation time. The major criticism of type checking is the added effort required to write type annotations. This is not an issue in Opa, which features full type inference and where type annotations are almost never needed.

Unfortunately, most people do not appreciate the advantages of type-checking as:

* they're thinking of languages such as Java or C#, which don't come even close to type safety offered by languages such as Haskell or Ocaml (and Opa),
* to appreciate benefits of type-checking one really needs to experience it in practice -- the experience of satisfying all the complains of the type checker and then running the program for the first time and seeing that it works, is truly mind-blowing.

To conclude let me just say that I had the pleasure lately to interview the authors of the winner apps of the Opa Developer Challenge and I think it's no coincidence that two top placed developers mentioned type checking as one of the ``killer'' features of Opa:

_``Opa's type checking that covers both the client and server code is simply amazing and a great time saver. Like those who have worked with OCaml, Haskell or another strongly typed language know, if it compiles there is a good chance it works as well :).''_ +
 -- Tristan Sloughter, author of OpaDo, 2nd place winner of the Opa Developer Challenge

_``Static typing helps catch most bugs at compile time rather than a stack trace at run time.''_ +
 -- Vimalkumar Jeyakumar, author of box, the winner of the Opa Developer Challenge

Conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Growing popularity of projects such as Node.js or Opa, but also GWT, Ruby on Rails and others, which unify client and server-side coding, is a clear indication that the web of today is too complex and the programming model needs to be simplified. I hope this article I managed to indicate that Opa is not just ``yet another framework'' and that it really has something to offer in this programming landscape. For instance it's worth noting that none of the mentioned solutions features static, strong typing and hopefully I made a case above that this is a very important feature that you won't be able to live without, once you get to know it. So, indeed, why not get to know it? :). This blog and the friendly Opa community will help you make your first steps in the Opa world.
