Opa presentation at a game development meetup, GameJS
-----------------------------------------------------

Our founder, Henri, presented Opa recently at a http://www.meetup.com/gamesjs[Game meetup in San Francisco]. This was a great opportunity for Opa to be presented to a new audience. The on-line gaming world is faced with the challenge of the demise of Flash and there is a need to find a new programming language and platform to deliver the best on-line gaming experience in HTML5.

Why would you want to use Opa for writing games? Well, for a number of reasons:

- Opa is high-level and very concise. That means that, once you're fluent in it, you can make things happen _real_ fast. This increased productivity is very important for games, where you often need to experiment, prototype and evaluate many different approaches.
- Real-time communication with the server and between the players is a must in interactive, multi-player games. Opa's sessions make it as easy as it gets to set-up this kind of communication (I'll try to talk more about that in one of the upcoming technical posts).
- Games are not the easiest type of software to write: highly interactive, distributed among multiple-players, often involving intricate logic... Things are complex enough as it is, so why not get a boost of a strongly-typed language that will detect big part of programming mistakes already at compilation time?

There are already a number of great HTML5 games written in Opa and available open source: (entries below link to the sources on GitHub)

- https://github.com/mattgu74/OpaTetris[Tetris], roughly 600 lines of code.
- https://github.com/HenJi/OPAcman[Pac Man], roughly 1,100 lines of code.
- https://github.com/mads379/opa-chess[Chess], roughly 1,100 lines of code.
- http://poker.mlstate.com/[Opa poker] (not open-source).

Do you want to add yours to the list? :)
