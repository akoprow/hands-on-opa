Interactivity, event handling
-----------------------------

[icons=None, caption="Summary"]
[NOTE]
=======================
You will learn:

* How to handle event in Opa and write interactive apps.
* How application distribution works in Opa.
=======================

Let's start with a goal for this tutorial.

[icons=None, caption="Goal"]
[NOTE]
=======================
Write a web page showing: current time (updated every second)
and a button. Upon pressing the button a message should show
saying how many times this button was pressed *ever* (in total,
by all users, not only in this session).
=======================

I know this ``project'' sounds rather artificial, but it
has exactly the characteristics I'm looking for, as:

* it involves interactivity (time-triggered changes to the page),
* it involves user interaction (response to pressing the button),
* it involves server state (to keep count of all button presses),
* while still being simple enough for this tutorial :).

[NOTE]
=======================
If you are a web developer, write such an app in
_YourFavoriteLanguage_. No, seriously, I mean it.
No worries, I'll wait.
=======================

Why is it important? I want you to be able to *really*
compare Opa with the solution you were using up till now.
And if your excuse is that you don't have time then you
should *seriously* consider Opa where the complete solution
looks like this:

[source, opa]
------------------------
include::interactivity.opa[]
------------------------

and it took me 4 minutes to write it (yup, honestly).

Ok, fasten your seat belts.
